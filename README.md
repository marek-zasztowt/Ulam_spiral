# Ulam_spiral
This is my version of the Ulam spiral (not actually a spiral but circles). 

The original spiral is:

	37	36	35	34	33	32	31	
	38	17	16	15	14	13	30	
	39	18	 5	 4	 3	12	29	
	40	19	 6	 1	 2	11	28	
	41	20	 7	 8	 9	10	27	
	42	21	22	23	24	25	26	
	43	44	45	46	47	48	49

but in my version (circles):

	25	26	27	 28	 29	  30	 31	
	48	 9	10	 11	 12	  13	 32	
	47	24	 1	  2	  3	  14	 33	
	46	23	 9 	  0	  4	  15	 34	
	45	22	 7	  6	  5	  16	 35	
	44	21	20	 19	 18	  17	 36	
	43	42	41	 40	 39	  38	 37	

0 is red centre START point.

My version gives the same effect as the original.
You can change the board size and pixel size in the program. 
As part of the exercises, I use the Pygame library.
